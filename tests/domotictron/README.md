## üéØ Website demo
![Website Demo](https://github.com/vitor-antoni/linktree-template/blob/main/assets/gif-readme/gif-readme.gif)


## üíª Somethings you can do
The `index.html` can imports two differents snowfall effects, but you must choose between one of these. 
> Don't use both at the same time, it might seem a little strange.

If you want to keep default effect, don't change the lines where are this code:
```
<!-- Snowfall Background Animation -->
<section class="animated-background">
    <div id="stars1"></div>
    <div id="stars2"></div>
    <div id="stars3"></div>
</section>
<!-- End of Snowfall Background Animation -->
```

But, if you want, comment this code above. After commenting the code above, go to the end of `index.html`, you may see a code code like that: 
```
<!-- 
A different snowfall 
<script  src="snowfall.js"></script> 
-->
```
Uncomment this code and press `ctrl+s` for see the updates in your website.

## üìë Additional Information
This project was developed to contribute to the *open source* movement. Therefore, it doesn't have any complex code here.

I liked this project so much that I used it to develop a website for myself. You can see it [clicking here](https://links.vitor-antoni.com.br).

Furthermore, I must to give the credit to these people, that I got some pieces of code from their own projects to develop this.
